# CV+PytTorch Self-Study Course
4 week Computer Vision and PyTorch Self-Study Course. 1 hour per day.

Plan of this course was created by ChatGPT. I tested this plan and modified it.

The course was tested on local PC with Jupyter Notebook. It seems to me it could be passed on Google Colab as well.

[Week 1. Neural networks and PyTorch basis](https://github.com/ArtyomR/CV-PytTorch-Self-Study-Course/tree/main/CV%20%2B%20PyTorch.%201W.%20Neural%20networks%2BPyTorch)
